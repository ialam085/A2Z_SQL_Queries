# üî≥ SQL Practice All Important Basic Queries ${\color{blue}(using\ SQL\ SERVER)}$


## ‚óªÔ∏è Objective

- The objective of the SQL report is to understand all the **Basic SQL-Server Queries** as well as all kind of **String Functions**.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Tech Stack

- SQL Server

## ‚óªÔ∏è Steps includes

- Creating a Database `FSA`
- Creating two Tables `Student` and `Exams`
- Applying all categories of SQL Commands

   - **DDL**: Defines database structures.
 
   - **DML**: Manipulates data.
 
   - **DQL**: Queries and retrieves data.

   - **DCL**: Manages access permissions.

   - **TCL**: Controls transactions.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Categories of applied SQL Commands
```diff
- DDL (Data Definition Language): DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc. All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.

+ CREATE
+ ALTER
+ DROP
+ TRUNCATE

- DML (Data Manipulation Language): DML commands are used to modify the database. The command of DML is not auto-committed that means it can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.

+ INSERT
+ UPDATE
+ DELETE

- DQL (Data Query Language): DQL is used to fetch the data from the database. It uses only one command.

+ SELECT

- DCL (Data Control Language): DCL commands are used to Grant and Revoke (take back) authority from any database user.

+ GRANT
+ REVOKE

- TCL (Transaction Control Language): TCL commands can only use with DML commands like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only.

+ BEGIN TRANSACTION
+ COMMIT
+ ROLLBACK
+ SAVEPOINT
```
